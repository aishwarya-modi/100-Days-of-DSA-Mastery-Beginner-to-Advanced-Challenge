Introduction to Arrays
An array is a fundamental data structure used in programming for storing a collection of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. It provides a convenient way to organize and access data.

Example
Suppose we want to store the scores of students in a class. We can use an array to hold these scores. Let's declare an array named scores to store the scores:

In Python:
scores = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] 
scores = [0]*n # Declares a list named "scores" initialized with n zeros
Arrays in Go are fixed-size sequences of elements of the same type. They provide a way to store multiple elements of the same type under a single name.

Example
Suppose we want to store the scores of students in a class. We can use an array to hold these scores. Let's declare an array named scores to store the scores:
var scores [5]int // Declares an array named "scores" capable of holding 5 integer values
You can access individual elements of the array using their indices..
