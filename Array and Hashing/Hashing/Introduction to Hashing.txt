Introduction to Hashing
Hashing is a technique used in computer science to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. It is commonly used for data retrieval and storage. A hash function is a mathematical function that converts an input into a fixed-size value called a hash code or hash value.

Example
Suppose we have a list of student names and we want to store their scores in a data structure for quick access. We can use hashing to achieve this.

# Define a hash table to store scores by student name
scores = {}
